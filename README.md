🛡️ Cybersecurity Fundamentals – Hands-On Project Suite

This repository contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects developed to gain practical exposure to network security, web application security, Linux system hardening, password security, and network traffic analysis.

The work focuses on understanding real-world security issues, identifying common vulnerabilities, and applying basic defensive security practices using industry-standard tools in controlled lab environments.


1️⃣ Network Reconnaissance & Port Scanning
🎯 Objective

To identify live hosts, open ports, and running services and understand their basic security implications.

🛠 Tools

Nmap

Kali Linux

📌 Work Performed

Host discovery on local network

TCP port scanning

Service and version detection

Documentation of exposed services

📄 Evidence

Commands: nmap_commands.txt

Scan output: scan_results.txt

Logs: logs/nmap_scan.log

Findings report: findings_report.md

🔍 Key Learnings

Open ports increase attack surface

Service version disclosure may reveal vulnerabilities

Unused services should be disabled

2️⃣ Web Application Vulnerability Testing (OWASP Top 10)
🎯 Objective

To identify common web vulnerabilities using intentionally vulnerable applications.

🛠 Tools

Burp Suite

DVWA / OWASP Juice Shop

📌 Vulnerabilities Tested

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Input validation flaws

📄 Evidence

Intercepted requests: burp_requests.txt

Logs: logs/burp_proxy.log, logs/burp_repeater.log

Vulnerability analysis: vulnerability_report.md

🔍 Key Learnings

Improper input validation leads to serious attacks

Authentication mechanisms can be bypassed

Secure coding practices are essential

3️⃣ Password Management System
🎯 Objective

To understand secure password storage concepts and basic access control.

🛠 Technology

Python

📌 Features Implemented

Password hashing (SHA-256)

Simple authentication logic

No plaintext password storage

📄 Evidence

Code: password_manager.py

Logs: logs/app.log

Explanation: password-manager/README.md

🔍 Key Learnings

Hashing protects stored credentials

Plaintext password storage is insecure

Authentication logic must be carefully implemented

4️⃣ Network Traffic Analysis
🎯 Objective

To analyze network packets and understand protocol behavior and insecure communication.

🛠 Tool

Wireshark

📌 Work Performed

Live traffic capture

Protocol filtering (HTTP, DNS, TCP)

Packet inspection

📄 Evidence

Filters used: wireshark_filters.txt

Logs: logs/packet_capture.log, logs/dns_capture.log

Analysis report: analysis_report.md

🔍 Key Learnings

HTTP traffic transmits data in plaintext

DNS traffic reveals queried domains

Encryption is critical for secure communication

5️⃣ Linux System Security Configuration
🎯 Objective

To implement basic Linux system hardening techniques.

🛠 Tools & Commands

Linux permissions

UFW firewall

System service auditing

📌 Tasks Performed

User permission management

Firewall rule configuration

Identification of unnecessary services

📄 Evidence

Commands: hardening_commands.sh

Logs: logs/auth.log, logs/ufw.log

Notes: security_notes.md

🔍 Key Learnings

Proper permissions prevent unauthorized access

Firewalls restrict unwanted network traffic

Service auditing reduces system exposure

🧠 Skills & Concepts Gained

Network reconnaissance and scanning

Web application security testing

OWASP Top 10 fundamentals

Password security & hashing

Network traffic analysis

Linux security hardening
